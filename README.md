- Iâ€™m currently working on a lot of Mindustry mods like a mod that replicates Minecraft (WIP), translation mods or other mods that are just for fun!
- I have way too many Mindustry mods and still creating new ones even tho there are like none that I actually finish. Please be pacient about updates, I haven't forgotten them!!!
- How to reach me: Discord: yoru_kitsu
- I'm also available to translate your Mindustry mods from english to german so feel free to dm me on discord!
- I'm learning JavaScript and I am trying to make Java and JavaScript mods to learn how it works (still just trying random things)

Mods I spend the most time on currently:
- Craftdustry: Survival (private)
- Simpledustry v2 (private major update)
