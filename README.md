- I'm a Mindustry mod developer and I make probably the most unusual mods ever. I make texture-packs, content mods, map-packs, gamemodes, planet mods and more!
- I have way too many Mindustry mods and still creating new ones even tho there are like none that I have actually finished. Please be pacient about updates, I haven't forgotten them!!!
- How to reach me: Discord link in my profile
- I'm also available to translate your Mindustry mods from english to german!

Mods I spend the most time on currently:
- Simpledustry V2 (Major update)
- Beskar V2 (Major Update)
