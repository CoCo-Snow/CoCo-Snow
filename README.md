- I'm a Mindustry mod developer and making probably the most unusual mods ever. I make texture packs, content mods, map-packs, gamemodes, planet mods, translation mods and more!
- Updates may take up to 1-3 years (like actually)
- How to reach me: Discord - coco.snow
- I'm also available to translate your Mindustry mods from english to german and the other way around!

Mod I spend the most time on currently:
- German: Rewritten
