- I'm a Mindustry mod developer and I make probably the most unusual mods ever. I make texture-packs, translation mods, content mods, map-packs, gamemodes, planet mods and more!
- I have way too many Mindustry mods and still creating new ones even tho there are like none that I have actually finished. Please be pacient about updates, I haven't forgotten them!!!
- How to reach me: Discord: coco.snow
- I'm also available to translate your Mindustry mods from english to german so feel free to dm me on discord!

Mods I spend the most time on currently:
- HD-Dustry (Not published yet)
- Simpledustry V2 (Major update)
